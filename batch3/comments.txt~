Batch 3 (a batch of 250 images).
10 'fail' logs so far. Still processing through the 250.

The 10 I shall refer to via these identifiers:
64921
64936
64942
64947
64953
64958
64964
64981
64993
65000

Notes:

65000 is an extremely atypical diagram and it is unsurprising the program cannot process it. Ignore.

64993 I can only guess what is wrong with this image. Perhaps the double thickness edges?

64981 Bars on nodes both filled and non-filled circles. Problem?

64964 Seems like one pixel is chomped out of each node. Problem?

64958 Arrows pointing to nodes are perhaps the problem here?

64953 Unknown what the problem is here

64947 Very 'flat' relationships between many taxa

64942 The '85' node annotation might be muddling things here?

64936

64921
